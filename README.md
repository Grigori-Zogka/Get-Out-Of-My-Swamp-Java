Game Rules

“Get Out of My Swamp” 



In this game an ogre, called ‘Hek’, wanders around his swamp, if he encounters an ogre enemy in his swamp he kills it.  If he encounters two ogre enemies in the same place they kill the ogre and the game ends.   Full details of the game are given below.


When the game starts the ogre is placed in a random square (i.e. part of the swamp).  However he must not be placed in the top left hand corner of the swamp when the game starts, although he can move there during the game.

Ogre
When the ogre moves, he can move to any of the neighbouring squares as shown below.   The ogre cannot move out of the swamp. 
The square the ogre moves to is chosen at random from all the possible squares that it can move to. 

Ogre Enemies
There are three types of ogre enemies that can inhabit HEk’s swamp; a snake, a parrot and a donkey.   There is a hole in the fence around Hek’s swamp in the top left corner and this is where the enemies enter the swamp.   Once in the swamp the enemies move in exactly the same way as the ogre; i.e. they move randomly to any of the neighbouring squares.  Ogre enemies cannot move out of the swamp.

Every time Hek moves there is a one in three chance of an enemy entering the swamp, the type of enemy is completely random.

Conflict
If the ogre moves into the same square as an enemy, the ogre kills the enemy and the enemy is removed from the swamp.   If the ogre moves into the same square as two or more enemies, the enemies kill the ogre and the game is over.
